The naming convention is fairly simple, lets dissect a few examples:

e_N2ab1sgp, 

e_ - electron, 
N2 - molecular nitrogen
O2 - molecular oxygen
O  - oxygen

             __ +
           1 \
ab1sgp - a"   >
             /_ g


e_O1D - electron exitation of O(1D)

e_O2_8p4 - electron excitation of the many states in molecular oxygen
	   close to 8.4 eV

e_N2vib0_2 - from ground state to second vibrational level.

e_O2elastic - Xs for elastic collisions

e_O2ion - Xs for ionisation

e_O2dion - Xs for dissociative ionisation

e_N2dissociation - Xs for dissociation
