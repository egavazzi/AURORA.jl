# [Input Flux](@id Input-Flux)

The input flux describes the precipitating electron flux injected at the top of the
simulated ionosphere. It is the primary "forcing" of an AURORA simulation and is fully
specified by an [`InputFlux`](@ref) object, which combines:

- an **energy spectrum** ([`AbstractSpectrum`](@ref)) — the shape of the differential
  number flux as a function of energy, and
- a **temporal modulation** ([`AbstractModulation`](@ref)) — how that flux varies in time.

Once an `InputFlux` is built, it is bundled with an [`AuroraModel`](@ref) into an
[`AuroraSimulation`](@ref) and executed with [`run!`](@ref). Internally, `run!` calls
[`compute_flux`](@ref) to produce the full 3-D flux array `Ie_top` of shape
`[n_beams, n_t, n_E]` (units: #e⁻/m²/s).

!!! note "Units"
    Energy flux (`IeE_tot`) is always given in **W/m²**. Energies and characteristic
    energies (`E₀`, `ΔE`, `E_min`) are in **eV**.

## Spectrum types

A spectrum controls the *energy shape* of the input flux. All built-in spectrum types
are sub-types of [`AbstractSpectrum`](@ref) and are normalized so that the integrated
energy flux equals `IeE_tot` (W/m²).

| Type | Shape | Key parameters |
|------|-------|----------------|
| [`FlatSpectrum`](@ref) | Uniform Φ(E) = const above `E_min` | `IeE_tot`, `E_min` |
| [`GaussianSpectrum`](@ref) | Φ(E) ∝ exp(-(E-E₀)²/ΔE²) | `IeE_tot`, `E₀`, `ΔE` |
| [`MaxwellianSpectrum`](@ref) | Maxwellian + optional low-energy tail | `IeE_tot`, `E₀` |
| [`FileSpectrum`](@ref) | Loaded from a `.mat` file | `filename`, `interpolation` |

`FileSpectrum` is the exception: it loads the *complete* flux distribution (including any
time dependence) directly from a file, so it must be used with
[`ConstantModulation`](@ref) and cannot be combined with other modulation types.

### Examples

```@example custom_input
using AURORA

# Flat spectrum: 10 mW/m² above 100 eV
flat = FlatSpectrum(1e-2; E_min=100)

# Gaussian: 10 mW/m², peaked at 5 keV with 500 eV width
gauss = GaussianSpectrum(1e-2, 5000.0, 500.0)

# Maxwellian: 10 mW/m², characteristic energy 1 keV
maxw = MaxwellianSpectrum(1e-2, 1000.0)
```

## Modulation types

A modulation controls the *time dependence* of the flux. All modulation types are
sub-types of [`AbstractModulation`](@ref). The modulation factor (a value between 0 and 1)
is multiplied by the base spectrum at every time step.

| Type | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| [`ConstantModulation`](@ref) | Flux is constant (switches on at t = 0). Default. |
| [`SinusoidalFlickering`](@ref) | Smooth oscillation at frequency `f` Hz |
| [`SquareFlickering`](@ref) | On/off square-wave at frequency `f` Hz |
| [`SmoothOnset`](@ref) | C∞-smooth ramp from 0 to 1 over `[t_start, t_end]` |

### Examples

```@example custom_input
# 5 Hz sinusoidal flickering
sin_mod = SinusoidalFlickering(5.0)

# 10 Hz square wave with 50% modulation depth
sq_mod = SquareFlickering(10.0; amplitude=0.5)

# Smooth onset from 0 to 1 over the first 0.1 s
onset = SmoothOnset(0.0, 0.1)
nothing # hide
```

## Building an InputFlux

[`InputFlux`](@ref) is the top-level object that bundles a spectrum, a modulation, the
set of pitch-angle beams that carry the precipitating electrons (`beams`), and an optional
source altitude (`z_source`).

**`beams`** selects which pitch-angle beams receive precipitating flux. Beam indices
correspond to the downward-pointing elements of the pitch-angle grid (i.e. beams with
μ < 0). Upward-going beams are always forced to zero inside `compute_flux`.
The total spectrum is divided among the selected beams weighted by their solid angle
(Ω_beam), so the total energy flux is preserved regardless of how many beams are chosen.

**`z_source`** (km) is the altitude from which electrons are launched. If set, electrons
of different energies and pitch angles acquire a *travel-time delay* before reaching the
top of the ionosphere — faster (higher energy) electrons arrive earlier. This produces
realistic energy- and angle-dependent timing when combined with a flickering modulation.
If omitted (`NaN`, the default), all electrons arrive at the top of the ionosphere
simultaneously with no delay.

### Steady-state example

```@example custom_input
# Flat spectrum from 2900 eV to E_max.
# No modulation is needed; ConstantModulation is the default.
flux = InputFlux(FlatSpectrum(1e-2; E_min=2900); beams=1:2)
```

### Time-dependent examples

```@example custom_input
# Sinusoidal flickering at 5 Hz, electrons sourced 3000 km above the ionosphere top.
# The travel-time delay is applied automatically for each energy and pitch angle.
flux_td1 = InputFlux(FlatSpectrum(1e-2; E_min=100), SinusoidalFlickering(5.0);
                     beams=1, z_source=3000.0)
```

```@example custom_input
# Maxwellian spectrum with a smooth onset over the first 0.1 s.
flux_td2 = InputFlux(MaxwellianSpectrum(1e-2, 1000.0), SmoothOnset(0.0, 0.1);
                     beams=1:2)
```

```@example custom_input
# Square-wave flickering at 10 Hz with 50% modulation depth.
flux_td3 = InputFlux(GaussianSpectrum(1e-2, 5000.0, 500.0), SquareFlickering(10.0; amplitude=0.5);
                     beams=1)
```

## Loading flux from a file

[`FileSpectrum`](@ref) loads a time-dependent flux distribution directly from a `.mat`
file. This is useful when you have measured or externally computed input fluxes.

### File format

The `.mat` file must contain the variable `Ie_total` with shape **`[n_μ, n_t_file, n_E]`**
(units: #e⁻/m²/s), and optionally `t_top` (a vector of length `n_t_file`, in seconds).

| Dimension | Meaning | Constraint |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| dim 1 — `n_μ` | pitch-angle beams | must **exactly** match the model's beam count |
| dim 2 — `n_t_file` | time steps in the file | flexible (see interpolation) |
| dim 3 — `n_E` | energy bins | must be **≥** the model's `n_E`; only first `n_E` bins used |

!!! warning "Strict beam/energy alignment"
    AURORA does **not** interpolate in the pitch-angle or energy dimensions when loading
    from a file. The array is indexed directly, so the grids of the file and the simulation
    model must correspond exactly. If they do not, the results will be silently wrong or an
    error will be raised.

### Matching the grids

Before writing a file, build an `AuroraModel` with the same settings you intend to use
for the simulation, then read the grids from it:

```@example custom_input
using MAT

# Build the model (same settings as the simulation that will use the file)
msis_file = find_msis_file()
iri_file  = find_iri_file()
θ_lims = 180:-10:0
E_max  = 1000.0
model  = AuroraModel([100, 600], θ_lims, E_max, msis_file, iri_file, 13)

# Extract the grids your file must be aligned to
μ_center = model.pitch_angle_grid.μ_center  # length n_μ
E_centers = model.energy_grid.E_centers     # length n_E
n_μ = length(μ_center)
n_E = length(E_centers)
println("") # hide
```

### Writing the file

```@example custom_input
# Example: time-dependent flux, 100 time steps
t_file = collect(0.0:0.01:0.99)   # 100 steps, dt = 10 ms
n_t_file = length(t_file)

Ie_total = zeros(n_μ, n_t_file, n_E)
# ... fill Ie_total with your flux values ...

flux_filepath = "my_flux.mat"
flux_filepath = tempname() * ".mat"  # hide — redirect to OS temp so the file is not deployed to gh-pages
matwrite(flux_filepath, Dict(
    "Ie_total" => Ie_total,
    "t_top"    => t_file,
))
```

### Using the file

```@example custom_input
flux = InputFlux(FileSpectrum(flux_filepath; interpolation=:linear))
```

Available interpolation schemes: `:constant` (default, nearest), `:linear`, `:pchip`
(piecewise cubic Hermite).

## Visualizing the input flux

AURORA provides plotting functions via a Makie extension. Load a Makie backend to
visualize the input flux applied at the top boundary:

```julia
using CairoMakie   # or GLMakie for interactive plots

# Plot the input flux (requires a simulation object)
fig = plot_input(sim)
```

See the [Visualization](../40-api/visualization.md) API page for more plotting and
animation functions.
